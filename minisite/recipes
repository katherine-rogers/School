<h3>Peanut Butter and Jelly Doughnuts</h3>
<p>Ingredients

    2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast
    1/4 cup warm water (110° to 115°)
    3/4 cup warm full-fat milk (110° to 115°)
    5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
    1/3 cup granulated sugar, plus more for rolling the doughnuts in
    1 egg yolk + 1 egg, at room temperature
    1 teaspoon salt
    3 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
    1/4 cup jelly
    1/4 cup Jif Creamy Peanut Butter
    1 egg white, lightly beaten
    2 cups Crisco Vegetable Oil, for frying</p>

<p>Instructions

    In a small bowl dissolve yeast in warm water, set aside and allow it to foam up; about 5 minutes.
    In a large bowl combine warm milk and butter, whisk until butter has completely dissolved. Add in sugar, egg yolk and egg, salt, yeast mixture and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft ball of dough (don't knead the dough just yet).
    Place ball of dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover tightly with saran wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
    When the hour has passed:
    Punch the dough down and turn it onto a lightly floured surface; knead 8 times.
    Divide the dough in half, creating two even sized balls of dough.
    Roll each portion out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut each side with a lightly floured 2-1/2-in. round cutter. Place 1/2 teaspoon of peanut butter and 1/2 teaspoon jelly in the center of half of the circles. Brush the edges lightly with egg white, then top with remaining circles. Press the edges together tightly to seal.
    Place on greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
    When ready to fry, heat oil to 360°. Fry doughnuts, a few at a time, for 1-2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, then roll the warm doughnuts in extra sugar.</p>
